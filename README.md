# Network-Programming
Basic codes for network protocols and concepts.
This repository contains codes for the following concept:

1. Client-Server - This is a very simple java code for demonstrating the client-server architecture and communication between them.

2. Cyclic Redundancy Check - This is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data.

3. Distance Vector Routing Protocol - DVRP is a routing protocol that decides the best route for data packets based on distance. I've implemented the same in C and Java.

4. Frame Stuffing - Demonstrates bit and byte stuffing done at the Data Link Layer to define variable-sized frames. Also implemented the encoding and decoding of the network frames.

5. Network Class Division - A code determining the class of an IP address and its corresponding subnet mask.

6. Sliding Window - This protocol is a feature of packet-based data transmission protocols. They are used where reliable in-order delivery of packets is required, such as in the data link layer as well as in the Transmission Control Protocol. The protocol is demonstrated using the client-server communication.

7. Stop and Wait - A protocol for sending information between 2 connected devices. It ensures that information is not lost due to dropped packets and that packets are received in the correct order. An implementation of the same in Java.
